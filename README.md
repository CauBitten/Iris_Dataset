# Iris
<p>This is a classic classification machine learning problem.</p>

### How?
<p>It consists of data about iris flowers, with features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.</p>
<p>The goal is to predict the species of iris flower based on these features.</p>

### How I did?
<p>At first, I evaluated some classification models.</p>
<p>Then I gave some data to predict the specie using the best model.</p>
